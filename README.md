# biolizard-project-template
:tada: Congratulations on creating a new repository from the project template! :tada: 

Currently we are quite flexible how you organise your repositories, but they should adhere to the following:

## 1. A clear README.md file
Replace this README.md file with a clear descriptive file that contains information about:

- What the project does
- Why the project is useful
- How users can get started with the project
- Where users can get help with your project


## 2. Read up on our Github Flow & Best Practices before you start working

These are available on our [Notion](https://www.notion.so/biolizard/GitHub-4b6906e26c9a4cf78b4578f925e56f40) page
